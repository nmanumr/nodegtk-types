/**
  * The Gtk.HandleBox widget allows a portion of a window to be “torn
off”. It is a bin widget which displays its child and a handle that
the user can drag to tear off a separate window (the “float
window”) containing the child widget. A thin
“ghost” is drawn in the original location of the
handlebox. By dragging the separate window back to its original
location, it can be reattached.
