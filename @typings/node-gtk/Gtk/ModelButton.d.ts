  * Gtk.ModelButton is a button class that can use a Gio.Action as its model.
In contrast to Gtk.ToggleButton or Gtk.RadioButton, which can also
be backed by a Gio.Action via the Gtk.Actionable :action-name property,
Gtk.ModelButton will adapt its appearance according to the kind of
action it is backed by, and appear either as a plain, check or
radio button.
