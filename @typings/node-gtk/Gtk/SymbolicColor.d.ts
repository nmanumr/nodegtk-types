  * Gtk.SymbolicColor is a boxed type that represents a symbolic color.
It is the result of parsing a
‘color expression [gtkcssprovider-symbolic-colors]’.

be resolved with Gtk.SymbolicColor.resolve(), which replaces all
symbolic color references by the colors they refer to (in a given

in a Gdk.RGBA value.
