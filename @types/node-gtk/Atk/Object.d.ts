/**
  * This class is the primary class for accessibility support via the
Accessibility ToolKit (ATK).  Objects which are instances of
Atk.Object (or instances of Atk.Object-derived types) are queried
for properties which relate basic (and generic) properties of a UI
component such as name and description.  Instances of Atk.Object
may also be queried as to whether they implement other ATK
interfaces (e.g. Atk.Action, Atk.Component, etc.), as appropriate
to the role which a given UI component plays in a user interface.
