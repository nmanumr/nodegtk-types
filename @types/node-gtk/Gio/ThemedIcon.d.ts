/**
  * Gio.ThemedIcon is an implementation of Gio.Icon that supports icon themes.
Gio.ThemedIcon contains a list of all of the icons present in an icon
theme, so that icons can be looked up quickly. Gio.ThemedIcon does
not provide actual pixmaps for icons, just the icon names.
Ideally something like gtk_icon_theme_choose_icon() should be used to
resolve the list of names so that fallback icons work nicely with
themes that inherit other themes.
