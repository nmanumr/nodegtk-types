/**
  * Gtk.PopoverMenu is a subclass of Gtk.Popover that treats its
children like menus and allows switching between them. It is
meant to be used primarily together with Gtk.ModelButton, but
any widget can be used, such as Gtk.SpinButton or Gtk.Scale.
In this respect, Gtk.PopoverMenu is more flexible than popovers
that are created from a Gio.MenuModel with Gtk.Popover.new_from_model().
