  * An icon factory manages a collection of Gtk.IconSet; a Gtk.IconSet manages a
set of variants of a particular icon (i.e. a Gtk.IconSet contains variants for
different sizes and widget states). Icons in an icon factory are named by a
stock ID, which is a simple string identifying the icon. Each Gtk.Style has a
list of Gtk.IconFactory derived from the current theme; those icon factories
are consulted first when searching for an icon. If the theme doesn’t set a
particular icon, GTK+ looks for the icon in a list of default icon factories,
maintained by Gtk.IconFactory.add_default() and
Gtk.IconFactory.remove_default(). Applications with icons should add a default
icon factory with their icons, which will allow themes to override the icons
for the application.
