  * Generated when a pointer or keyboard grab is broken. On X11, this happens
when the grab window becomes unviewable (i.e. it or one of its ancestors
is unmapped), or if the same application grabs the pointer or keyboard
again. Note that implicit grabs (which are initiated by button presses)
can also cause Gdk.EventGrabBroken events.
