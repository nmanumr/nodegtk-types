  * Proximity events are generated when using GDK’s wrapper for the
XInput extension. The XInput extension is an add-on for standard X
that allows you to use nonstandard devices such as graphics tablets.
A proximity event indicates that the stylus has moved in or out of
contact with the tablet, or perhaps that the user’s finger has moved
in or out of contact with a touch screen.
