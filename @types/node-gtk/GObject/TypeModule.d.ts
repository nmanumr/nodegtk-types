  * GObject.TypeModule provides a simple implementation of the GObject.TypePlugin
interface. The model of GObject.TypeModule is a dynamically loaded module
which implements some number of types and interface implementations.
When the module is loaded, it registers its types and interfaces
using GObject.TypeModule.register_type() and GObject.TypeModule.add_interface().
As long as any instances of these types and interface implementations
are in use, the module is kept loaded. When the types and interfaces
are gone, the module may be unloaded. If the types and interfaces
become used again, the module will be reloaded. Note that the last
unref cannot happen in module code, since that would lead to the
callerâ€™s code being unloaded before GObject.Object.unref() returns to it.
